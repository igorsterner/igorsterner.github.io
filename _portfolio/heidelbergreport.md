| For the month of August     |        |                               |
| 2022, I joined Heidelberg   |        |                               |
| University in Germany as a  |        |                               |
| student of the              |        |                               |
| International Summer School |        |                               |
| of Language and Culture. It |        |                               |
| is the oldest course of its |        |                               |
| kind in Germany and         |        |                               |
| uniquely positioned to      |        |                               |
| welcome students of all     |        |                               |
| levels and all background.  |        |                               |
| Every sixth participant was |        |                               |
| from a different country,   |        |                               |
| with around 350 students    |        |                               |
| joining this year as        |        |                               |
| compared to the             |        |                               |
| pre-pandemic regular 600.   |        |                               |
| Under the backdrop of the   |        |                               |
| European energy crisis,     |        |                               |
| Brexit and all-round        |        |                               |
| turbulent geo-politics, the |        |                               |
| theme of this year's course |        |                               |
| was aptly "Germany Between  |        |                               |
| Continuity and Change".     |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| Spending four weeks living  |        |                               |
| in a German university      |        |                               |
| city, interacting with      |        |                               |
| local students, and         |        |                               |
| studying the language every |        |                               |
| day was an experience like  |        |                               |
| no other. It was immersive  |        |                               |
| in a totally different way  |        |                               |
| to living with a German     |        |                               |
| family; instead I truly     |        |                               |
| felt like I became a German |        |                               |
| student.                    |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| In this report I intend to  |        |                               |
| set out my ever more        |        |                               |
| intimate relationship with  |        |                               |
| the German language, the    |        |                               |
| reasons behind my decision  |        |                               |
| to take part in this        |        |                               |
| course, my objectives, a    |        |                               |
| condensed diary of key      |        |                               |
| events on it, the costs     |        |                               |
| involved and my concluding  |        |                               |
| remarks.                    |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| # 02 Background             |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| My German studies began in  |        |                               |
| secondary school, where I   |        |                               |
| completed my iGCSE.         |        |                               |
| Afterwards I made the tough |        |                               |
| decision to stop studying   |        |                               |
| the language under any      |        |                               |
| formal curriculum, as my    |        |                               |
| engineering aspirations     |        |                               |
| constrained my A-Levels and |        |                               |
| I did not find the          |        |                               |
| opportunity to pursue it in |        |                               |
| the same way as my Mandarin |        |                               |
| at a Saturday school.       |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| Instead I made friends with |        |                               |
| those taking German A-Level |        |                               |
| at Tiffin School, purchased |        |                               |
| the textbook (which         |        |                               |
| admittedly I never opened)  |        |                               |
| and took my chance to speak |        |                               |
| where it arose. I ended up  |        |                               |
| making friends with some    |        |                               |
| German students on an       |        |                               |
| exchange program, one of    |        |                               |
| whom I am still in touch    |        |                               |
| with.                       |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| On the outset of the        |        |                               |
| pandemic and the abrupt     |        |                               |
| *remotification* of my      |        |                               |
| engineering studies, I      |        |                               |
| spent my hours figuring out |        |                               |
| how the Deutsche Bahn       |        |                               |
| 'supersparpreis'            |        |                               |
| \[supersaver price\]        |        |                               |
| functioned. I figured out   |        |                               |
| how to seek out cheap ICE   |        |                               |
| train tickets across        |        |                               |
| Germany, as it was the one  |        |                               |
| country to which you could  |        |                               |
| fly, restriction free.      |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| I distinctly remember       |        |                               |
| flying out on 20 June 2020, |        |                               |
| on a rather empty flight to |        |                               |
| Berlin. I visited some      |        |                               |
| friends around northern     |        |                               |
| Germany, before making my   |        |                               |
| way down south to visit the |        |                               |
| exchange student with whom  |        |                               |
| I had stayed in touch with  |        |                               |
| over the years. The 10 day  |        |                               |
| trip came to an             |        |                               |
| unfortunately-quick end. So |        |                               |
| I began planning the next.  |        |                               |
| With rock-bottom flight     |        |                               |
| prices, 10 Euro (more       |        |                               |
| expensive than the 9 Euro   |        |                               |

| Euro hostel beds-turn-room  |        |                               |
| since things were so empty, |        |                               |
| it was all very affordable  |        |                               |
| to a student.               |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| By the end of the summer, I |        |                               |
| had completed a full loop   |        |                               |
| of Germany and fallen in    |        |                               |
| love with it along the way. |        |                               |
| At this point I set my      |        |                               |
| hearts on working in        |        |                               |
| Germany the next summer.    |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| That didn't quite become a  |        |                               |
| reality, but I did land an  |        |                               |
| internship with a           |        |                               |
| middle-sized company based  |        |                               |
| in Munich. While the solo   |        |                               |
| travel had functioned well, |        |                               |
| tech companies were largely |        |                               |
| still in 'Home Office'. As  |        |                               |
| such I remained confined to |        |                               |
| my small room in Cambridge  |        |                               |
| and laptop screen. In the   |        |                               |
| weeks after, I did make an  |        |                               |
| independent trip to meet    |        |                               |
| some of my colleagues in    |        |                               |
| Munich and attend an event  |        |                               |
| the company had put on. To  |        |                               |
| my amazement, by this point |        |                               |
| I was able to understand a  |        |                               |
| whole technical lecture     |        |                               |
| given in German.            |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |

| I stumbled across the       |        |                               |
| Heidelberg University       |        |                               |
| summer course by accident.  |        |                               |
| I had been looking to       |        |                               |
| continue to improve my      |        |                               |
| German and was aware there  |        |                               |
| was funding available in    |        |                               |
| Cambridge for language      |        |                               |
| courses. It looked          |        |                               |
| exciting, affordable with   |        |                               |
| funding and finally a       |        |                               |
| chance to see what it would |        |                               |
| be like living in Germany.  |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| I had visited Heidelberg    |        |                               |
| once before, on a short     |        |                               |
| change over the year        |        |                               |
| before. It seemed like a    |        |                               |
| larger version of           |        |                               |
| Cambridge, with a vibrant   |        |                               |
| and cool old town. I bought |        |                               |
| a laptop sticker that year  |        |                               |
| and it had followed me      |        |                               |
| around ever since as I had  |        |                               |
| worked on language          |        |                               |

| This summer school fitted   |        |                               |
| all the boxes: a language   |        |                               |
| school offering my level,   |        |                               |
| including an intriguing set |        |                               |
| of extra-curricular         |        |                               |

| # 04 Goals and objectives   |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| I became aware of the CEFR  |        |                               |
| system to demonstrate       |        |                               |
| language ability to a       |        |                               |
| particular level and that   |        |                               |
| many German                 |        |                               |
| universities/companies      |        |                               |
| require a minimum level to  |        |                               |
| join. Cambridge has also    |        |                               |
| taught me that to reach the |        |                               |

| engineering, you need clear |        |                               |
| goals. I set my heart on a  |        |                               |
| summer of language learning |        |                               |
| and to pass my B2 in        |        |                               |
| German. To be frank, at     |        |                               |
| this point I had no idea    |        |                               |
| what a *B2 in German*       |        |                               |
| entailed.                   |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| As mentioned, I was also    |        |                               |
| very keen to spend some     |        |                               |
| time living in Germany. I   |        |                               |
| wanted to find out how the  |        |                               |
| German way of living fitted |        |                               |
| with my experiences         |        |                               |
| travelling through the      |        |                               |
| country and what it might   |        |                               |
| be like to work or study    |        |                               |
| there in the future.        |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| Finally, I wanted to        |        |                               |
| continue my exploration of  |        |                               |
| southern Germany. I had met |        |                               |
| a Professor from the        |        |                               |
| University of Konstanz at a |        |                               |
| talk in Cambridge and of    |        |                               |
| course also wanted to       |        |                               |
| strengthen my relationship  |        |                               |
| with the company I had      |        |                               |
| worked for in Munich, so I  |        |                               |
| hoped to visit both. This   |        |                               |
| was partly to compare       |        |                               |
| student and working life in |        |                               |

| ## Arrival                  |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| I arrived at the 'New       |        |                               |
| University' building in     |        |                               |
| Heidelberg on the first     |        |                               |
| Friday of August. I         |        |                               |
| hesitantly went through the |        |                               |
| stages of registration they |        |                               |
| had set up, unsure whether  |        |                               |
| to attempt to use German or |        |                               |
| resort to English. It ended |        |                               |
| up being a mixture of both. |        |                               |
| Eventually I was told to    |        |                               |
| wait a while for someone to |        |                               |
| drive me to my room. Drive  |        |                               |
| me? Now I was a little      |        |                               |

| About an hour later, a      |        |                               |
| lovely student drove me the |        |                               |
| 15-minute journey to the    |        |                               |
| southern area of Kirchheim, |        |                               |
| where I was to stay. We     |        |                               |
| eventually drove adjacent   |        |                               |
| to the railway tracks and   |        |                               |
| he told me that this was    |        |                               |
| the road I'd be staying on. |        |                               |
| My eyes lit up - the houses |        |                               |
| looked lovely.              |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| But we kept driving, quite  |        |                               |
| a way: past the nice        |        |                               |
| houses, past the warehouses |        |                               |
| and nearing the end of the  |        |                               |
| road. Eventually, he        |        |                               |
| pointed at a small,         |        |                               |
| two-story, tired-looking    |        |                               |
| white complex. He said he'd |        |                               |
| passed many times and seen  |        |                               |
| fun pool parties going on,  |        |                               |
| but had never been in.      |        |                               |
| Cautiously, I took my stuff |        |                               |
| in and got to know my new   |        |                               |
| neighbour.                  |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| My neighbour was a delight, |        |                               |
| showing me around my room   |        |                               |
| and even offering to lend   |        |                               |
| me some bedding and a       |        |                               |
| towel. He explained how     |        |                               |
| everything worked in the    |        |                               |
| building. The outside looks |        |                               |
| had been deceiving: I had a |        |                               |
| kitchen to myself and we    |        |                               |
| would only be sharing a     |        |                               |
| bathroom between the two of |        |                               |
| us. My room was spacious,   |        |                               |
| with a double bed, a small  |        |                               |
| dining table with two       |        |                               |
| chairs and a desk to work   |        |                               |
| at. My phone reminded me    |        |                               |
| that it was a hungry 3pm,   |        |                               |
| so I went out in search of  |        |                               |
| food and ended up doing a   |        |                               |
| big set-up shop at the      |        |                               |
| local big REWE.             |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| ## First days               |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| After the opening ceremony  |        |                               |
| and a tour of town, I met   |        |                               |
| my class for the month. We  |        |                               |
| were a bunch of twelve,     |        |                               |
| from nine different         |        |                               |
| countries at last count.    |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| Each class had a main       |        |                               |
| teacher (75%) and a         |        |                               |
| secondary teacher (25%),    |        |                               |
| alongside a student mentor  |        |                               |
| who visited class everyday  |        |                               |
| for 15 mins to remind us    |        |                               |
| what was going on for the   |        |                               |
| day, deliver post and look  |        |                               |
| after us. We played some    |        |                               |
| ice-breaker games with our  |        |                               |
| mentor and then parted ways |        |                               |
| after some lunch.           |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| Classes were every morning: |        |                               |
| 09:15 -- 10:45 and again    |        |                               |
| 11:15 -- 12:45. Afterwards  |        |                               |
| we often sat down for lunch |        |                               |
| in the university           |        |                               |
| cafeteria, where food is    |        |                               |
| amusingly sold by weight of |        |                               |
| your plate. Each afternoon  |        |                               |
| there were seminars, all    |        |                               |
| labelled with German level  |        |                               |
| of difficulty and on a      |        |                               |
| range of topics: 14:00 --   |        |                               |
| 15:30 and 15:30 -- 17:00.   |        |                               |
| Finally in the evenings     |        |                               |
| there were workshops        |        |                               |
| (dance, singing, theatre,   |        |                               |
| journalism) or film/music   |        |                               |
| nights to attend, if you    |        |                               |
| wished. There was also a    |        |                               |
| whole schedule of sport     |        |                               |
| that one may choose to      |        |                               |
| attend. It became quite     |        |                               |
| apparent in my first week   |        |                               |
| that if I continued to      |        |                               |
| attend everything put on    |        |                               |
| for us, I was going to      |        |                               |
| drive myself to the ground. |        |                               |
| But for the first week I    |        |                               |
| drove myself to the ground  |        |                               |
| and gave it all a go.       |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| My accommodation was also a |        |                               |
| little while away from the  |        |                               |
| old town. Following         |        |                               |
| recommendation, I rented a  |        |                               |
| bike from SwapFiets for the |        |                               |
| month and made the          |        |                               |
| 20-minute cycle each        |        |                               |
| morning and evening.        |        |                               |
| Without this, it would have |        |                               |
| been a 45-minute commute to |        |                               |
| town, which could have been |        |                               |
| a little difficult for      |        |                               |
| some. By the end of the     |        |                               |
| course, the daily cycle did |        |                               |
| get somewhat tiring. This   |        |                               |
| was especially because I    |        |                               |
| did not go back during the  |        |                               |
| day. Instead I would cycle  |        |                               |
| in for morning class and    |        |                               |
| not return until after the  |        |                               |
| evening activities or stint |        |                               |

| As mentioned, I attended a  |        |                               |
| seminar in almost all of    |        |                               |
| the slots during the first  |        |                               |
| week. From writing-skills   |        |                               |
| to German politics, there   |        |                               |
| were seminars on almost all |        |                               |
| aspects of German life and  |        |                               |
| culture. For each seminar,  |        |                               |
| a detailed PDF handout was  |        |                               |
| made available to all       |        |                               |
| students on Microsoft       |        |                               |
| Teams. They were all also   |        |                               |
| very accessible to people   |        |                               |
| of all backgrounds, perhaps |        |                               |
| except for the 'Grammar for |        |                               |
| Experts' which for some     |        |                               |
| reason I don't remember     |        |                               |
| much of.                    |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| One seminar which I         |        |                               |
| particularly liked was      |        |                               |
| given by Andrea Brunner,    |        |                               |
| M.A. on the topic of the    |        |                               |
| international phonetic      |        |                               |
| standard. It explored the   |        |                               |
| rules for sound formation   |        |                               |
| and standard pronunciation  |        |                               |
| of German. It was a unique  |        |                               |
| opportunity to learn how    |        |                               |
| sounds are correctly formed |        |                               |
| in German, from an expert   |        |                               |

| The organisers had put      |        |                               |
| together many other         |        |                               |
| activities for us. In the   |        |                               |
| first week, we all received |        |                               |
| tickets to the castle and   |        |                               |
| we walked up together as a  |        |                               |
| class. We also enjoyed two  |        |                               |
| 'class evenings' which our  |        |                               |
| teacher joined us on. These |        |                               |
| were all opportunities to   |        |                               |
| speak more German, under    |        |                               |
| the guidance of our mentor  |        |                               |

| Each Tuesday, there was a   |        |                               |
| film evening. They would    |        |                               |
| stream an English-subtitled |        |                               |
| German movie in one of the  |        |                               |
| lecture halls, which was a  |        |                               |
| chance to practice your     |        |                               |
| listening skills. An        |        |                               |
| arrangement was also in     |        |                               |
| place where students could  |        |                               |
| buy tickets to the nearby   |        |                               |
| cinema for only 7 Euros.    |        |                               |
| Each Thursday, there was a  |        |                               |
| musical concert put on in a |        |                               |
| beautiful building in the   |        |                               |
| center of town. This ranged |        |                               |
| from classical cello-piano  |        |                               |
| performances to unique      |        |                               |
| combinations of non-German  |        |                               |

| ## Excursions               |        |                               |

| The organisers of the       |        |                               |
| summer course had put       |        |                               |
| together an excellent       |        |                               |
| selection of excursions     |        |                               |
| each weekend. On each day   |        |                               |
| of each weekend, there were |        |                               |
| two destinations that a     |        |                               |
| ticket for 5-25 Euros could |        |                               |
| be purchased for. The       |        |                               |
| prices this year were       |        |                               |
| particularly low as all     |        |                               |
| local trains were covered   |        |                               |
| by the 9 Euro ticket.       |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| On my first weekend, I went |        |                               |
| on a hike to a local        |        |                               |
| brewery to taste some of    |        |                               |
| the local beer. At first    |        |                               |
| this was rather daunting,   |        |                               |
| as I had not made any       |        |                               |
| friends that were also      |        |                               |
| going on this excursion.    |        |                               |
| But I quickly met some      |        |                               |
| other students and ended up |        |                               |
| chatting with them for most |        |                               |
| of the journey. The beer    |        |                               |
| tasting was an unlimited    |        |                               |
| supply to a huge vessel of  |        |                               |
| beer, to which one could    |        |                               |
| top up a glass given. We    |        |                               |
| were also given a very cool |        |                               |
| tour of the brewery to hear |        |                               |
| about some more of their    |        |                               |
| traditional methods.        |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| Another standout excursion  |        |                               |
| was my trip to the nearby   |        |                               |
| Ladenburg. While neither I  |        |                               |
| nor many of the other       |        |                               |
| German students had heard   |        |                               |
| of the town, it was a       |        |                               |
| delightful cycle away. A    |        |                               |
| friend from Amsterdam had   |        |                               |
| come to visit for the       |        |                               |
| weekend, so he joined       |        |                               |
| without any troubles. We    |        |                               |
| all sat down in a café for  |        |                               |
| a couple hours on arrival,  |        |                               |
| and then were given a very  |        |                               |
| entertaining tour of the    |        |                               |
| town. Turns out a certain   |        |                               |
| Frau Mercedes Benz lived    |        |                               |
| there for her whole life,   |        |                               |
| so many automobile-related  |        |                               |
| stories entailed!           |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| ## Goethe B2 Prep           |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| I mentioned my registration |        |                               |
| for the Goethe B2 to both   |        |                               |
| of my teachers, to mixed    |        |                               |
| reactions. My main teacher  |        |                               |
| was very supportive and     |        |                               |
| said I should work hard but |        |                               |
| would make it. The other    |        |                               |
| suggested it was rather     |        |                               |
| ambitious, and I needed to  |        |                               |
| bring my A game to pass.    |        |                               |
| While I was at first set    |        |                               |
| back by the second          |        |                               |
| reaction, the balance       |        |                               |
| between the two was very    |        |                               |
| motivating to get on with   |        |                               |
| some revision.              |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| This year there was no      |        |                               |
| official B2 preparatory     |        |                               |
| course being run on the     |        |                               |
| course, only B1. On         |        |                               |
| attending that, the         |        |                               |
| trainers recommended some   |        |                               |
| books. I ordered an         |        |                               |
| 'Express' preparatory book  |        |                               |
| that clearly set out what   |        |                               |
| was to be expected in each  |        |                               |
| section and how best to     |        |                               |
| attempt them. It also       |        |                               |
| contained two practice      |        |                               |
| tests: one which it went    |        |                               |
| through with you slowly and |        |                               |
| another to practice. This   |        |                               |
| formed the bulk of my work  |        |                               |
| (alongside class homeworks) |        |                               |
| for the next two weeks.     |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| My main teacher was kind    |        |                               |
| enough to correct my        |        |                               |
| written work and even went  |        |                               |
| through a whole practice    |        |                               |
| speaking exam with me.      |        |                               |
| Alongside this, one of the  |        |                               |
| other students in class who |        |                               |
| was training to be a        |        |                               |
| language teacher offered to |        |                               |
| help me. She'd done the     |        |                               |
| exam a few years back and   |        |                               |
| was an instrumental part in |        |                               |
| passing the test.           |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| Overall I was delighted to  |        |                               |
| receive 81% in my speaking, |        |                               |
| 68% in my writing, 77% in   |        |                               |
| my reading and 70% in my    |        |                               |
| listening. Given the pass   |        |                               |
| mark of 60%, these marks    |        |                               |
| were a testament to the     |        |                               |
| impact of the three weeks   |        |                               |
| of classes and seminars I   |        |                               |
| had attended in the summer  |        |                               |
| course so far.              |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| I took my B2 test on a      |        |                               |
| Friday in Munich, so        |        |                               |
| decided to continue with    |        |                               |
| some travels that weekend.  |        |                               |
| In the end I travelled      |        |                               |
| across into Austria and     |        |                               |
| then round into Switzerland |        |                               |
| to find the Professor in    |        |                               |
| Konstanz, returning to      |        |                               |
| Heidelberg that way.        |        |                               |
| Southern Germany is         |        |                               |
| extraordinarily positioned  |        |                               |
| in Europe and it was a      |        |                               |
| delight to enjoy that on    |        |                               |
| this weekend.               |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| ## Closing activities       |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| My summer course ended up   |        |                               |
| being structured with a fun |        |                               |
| week to begin, two weeks of |        |                               |
| hard work for my test and   |        |                               |
| an exciting and sociable    |        |                               |
| final week. Notably there   |        |                               |
| was a closing party on the  |        |                               |
| last Wednesday. Our class   |        |                               |
| had prepared a rap song,    |        |                               |
| which I've attached the     |        |                               |
| lyrics to at the end of     |        |                               |
| this report. This ended up  |        |                               |
| being a big hit with the    |        |                               |
| crowd, and great fun to     |        |                               |
| practice and perform! At    |        |                               |
| the party there was also a  |        |                               |
| lovely chance to say some   |        |                               |
| goodbyes and dance the      |        |                               |
| night away.                 |        |                               |
|                             |        |                               |
| The following morning, we   |        |                               |
| had a class breakfast with  |        |                               |
| our teacher at a local      |        |                               |
| breakfast café. This ended  |        |                               |
| up being delightful, with   |        |                               |
| the course organisers       |        |                               |
| paying for most of the meal |        |                               |
| and our teacher kindly      |        |                               |
| covering the rest. We had   |        |                               |
| grown close as a class over |        |                               |
| the four weeks and so this  |        |                               |
| was a final chance to come  |        |                               |

| Attending this course was a |        |                               |
| once in a lifetime          |        |                               |
| experience to study         |        |                               |
| alongside people from all   |        |                               |
| over the world. This        |        |                               |
| diversity came with         |        |                               |
| challenges as well as       |        |                               |
| enjoyment, but these were   |        |                               |
| challenges that have led to |        |                               |
| a great deal of personal    |        |                               |
| development. The additional |        |                               |
| challenge of integrating in |        |                               |
| a university environment    |        |                               |
| abroad has been a new       |        |                               |
| experience for me, but I    |        |                               |
| feel stronger and more able |        |                               |
| to confidently interact     |        |                               |
| with Germans as a result of |        |                               |
| it.                         |        |                               |

| I find the improvement in   |        |                               |
| my language fluency         |        |                               |
| remarkable. Speaking almost |        |                               |
| all everyday, switching     |        |                               |
| between structured and      |        |                               |
| unstructured environments   |        |                               |
| was perfect to propel my    |        |                               |
| German forward to its next  |        |                               |
| stage. I now feel           |        |                               |
| significantly more          |        |                               |

| hold a full conversation in |        |                               |
| the language. I importantly |        |                               |
| also feel much more         |        |                               |
| acquainted with German      |        |                               |
| culture, with a much better |        |                               |
| understanding of the        |        |                               |
