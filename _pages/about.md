I am an Engineering Master's student at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), specialising in [Information and Computing Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering). As a culmination to my past three years of study, I am taking advanced theoretical courses in deep learning, computer vision, information theory and computational neuroscience. 

My master's project is supervised by [Prof. Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/) on the topic of "Vision Encoders in Visual Question Answering". I am also undertaking a dissertation with [Prof. Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/) to continue my previous research on computational approaches to the linguistic phenomenon of Code-Switching.

My interests lie in the intersection of cutting-edge natural language processing research and the study of languages. As such, alongside my technical studies I have been a regular participant of courses at the [Centre for Languages and Inter-Communication](https://www.clic.eng.cam.ac.uk/) in German (passed Goethe B2 in 2022) and Chinese (preparing for HSK4).

My [CV](https://igorsterner.github.io/files/igorsternercv.pdf) gives more detail.
