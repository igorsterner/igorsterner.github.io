I am a graduate of [Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/) (BA + MEng) from the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/), specialising in [Information and Computing Engineering](http://www.eng.cam.ac.uk/research/academic-divisions/information-engineering). 
I received Honours with Distinction for my degree, with a first class result in both my fourth year examinations and master's project.
My master's project was supervised by [Professor Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/) on the topic of encoding visual information as input to large language models.

I was an undergraduate Diamond Jubilee Scholar of the [Institute of Engineering and Technology](https://www.theiet.org/), and have now received a full scholarship to join the [Advanced Computer Science](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/admissions/acs) program in the [Department of Computer Science and Technology](https://www.cst.cam.ac.uk/).
I will be continuing work with [Professor Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/) in the field of natural language processing. 

I am half-English, half-Swedish and have learnt Chinese (A-Level) and German (Goethe B2).
