I joined a team building an [internal translator tool](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1225038/next-generation-translator-for-confluence) for company pages on Confluence. In particular, TNG had recently opened a new office in Hungary and wanted to expand its internal tool (which at the time only supported German--English) to support German--Hungarian. Central to the project was, for privacy reasons, performing all computation on company-managed compute (no APIs).

In my project, I trained a transformer-based NMT model on various German--English parallel data, evaluated with ROUGE/METEOR metrics and performed a human evaluation.
