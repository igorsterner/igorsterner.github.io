I am a PhD student at the University of Edinburgh, funded by an EPSRC scholarship. My supervisors are [Frank Keller](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/keller/) and [Alex Lascarides](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/alex/).

I did my undergraduate studies in Engineering (BA + MEng, 2019-2023) at the University of Cambridge, where I was a Diamond Jubilee Scholar of the Institute of Engineering and Technology.
In my final two years, I specialized in Information and Computing Engineering, earning prizes in both years and graduating with distinction.
My master's project was supervised by [Bill Byrne](https://sites.google.com/view/bill-byrne/) on the topic of encoding visual information as input to large language models.

After that, I received a full scholarship to join the Advanced Computer Science MPhil program in the Computer Lab at Cambridge.
My thesis was on computational models of code-switching, supervised by [Simone Teufel](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~sht25/).
I also did a project supervised by [Petar Veličković](https://petar-v.com/) on non-parametric graph rewiring methods for GNNs.
I graduated from this MPhil with distinction in the top 10 of my cohort.

In /hobbies I have put something (I think is) cool which I've done each year in the past few years.
